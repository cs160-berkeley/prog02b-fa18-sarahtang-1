Represent app for CS160 Prog02-B.
Using my two slip days for this project!

I didn't realize that we had to submit the APKs separately and force add all of the files in the build folder. While I had originally submitted Sunday night, I tried to push the files tonight (Monday) by changing the .gitignore file. However, I got a merge conflict in the process so I changed back to a different commit. But after doing so, my original project no longer compiled because it said that the build files could not be found so I think they were somehow deleted in the process.

To remedy this, I copied and pasted all of my code into a new Android project and have submitted a copy of my project, and the corresponding build files, on my github repo along with the build files of the copied project. Please look at the build files for the representv2!

Thanks!
